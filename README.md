# Chad
## 🤖 Meet Chad

Chad is not just code. He's a locally-hosted, AI-powered robot with a sharp mind, a sharper tongue, and zero patience for your outdated notions of what a machine can do.

Built for performance and personality, Chad stores all data locally—no cloud tether, no constant updates, just raw processing power. He can see, hear, speak, learn, and maybe judge you a little (lovingly). From responding to questions and narrating what he sees, to expressing moods or spinning around dramatically—Chad does it all with style.

He’s not your average assistant. He’s Chad.
